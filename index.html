          <h3>The Game</h3>
          <p>
            After cards are distributed, the Flip Card is revealed from the top
            of the pile. It defines the Trump cards. <br />
            <br />
            Each hand has 3 rounds, where each player plays one card. Whatever
            team wins the most rounds gets the point. Initially each hand is
            worth 1 point, at every player's turn they may call Truco to
            increase the hand to 3 points. The other team then decide if they
            accept, raise it to 6 or run. If they run the team that called Truco
            wins. Hands can be raised to Truco, 6, 9 and 12. <br />
            If the first round is a draw, whoever wins the second round wins the
            Hand. If the second round is a draw, whoever won the first round
            wins the Hand. If the third round is a draw, whoever won the first
            round wins the Hand. When all 3 rounds are draws, the Hand is
            cancelled.
            <br />
            At the 11's Hand the players cant ask for Truco, if they do so, they
            automatically loose the game. The duo with 11 points can see each
            other's cards and decide if they want to play the hand, if they do,
            the hand is worth 3 points, if they run the opposing duo gets 1
            point.
            <br />
            If both teams reach 11 points then they play the Iron Hand, where
            all cards stay face down and players play blind.
