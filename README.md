# Truco
Truco card game project

Game card very popular in Brazil.

Using it to practice my skills in HTMLCSS/JavaScript.

I am new to JavaScript and learning on my own so if you would like to help me by giving me feedback on any of my code I welcome it.

I am also new to GitHub but this is an open source game and I would appreciate help coding, with ideas or general advice.
